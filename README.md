Getting Started
----------

Your development environment will require:
*  SBT / Play see [here]() for installation instructions.

Once the prerequisites have been installed, you will be able to execute the following from a terminal.

```
../modern-web-template >  activator run
```

This should fetch all the dependencies and start a Web Server listening on *localhost:9000*


Note: The new play 2.3 sometimes reloads the content too much so it's better the start command.

```
../modern-web-template >  activator start
```
